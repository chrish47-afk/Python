    "### A. Randomization\n",
    "- Users must be randomly assigned to either group to prevent bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Sample Size & Statistical Power\n",
    "- Ensure a large enough sample size to detect meaningful differences.\n",
    "- Common significance level (α) and power:\n",
    "  - α = 0.05 (5% risk of false positives)\n",
    "  - Power = 0.8 (80% chance of detecting real differences)\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Statistical Significance (p-value)\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** \"No difference between A and B.\"\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** \"There is a difference.\"\n",
    "- A p-value < 0.05 means we reject H₀.\n",

    "- **Type I Error (False Positive):** Wrongly detecting a difference.\n",
    "- **Type II Error (False Negative):** Failing to detect a real difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Statistical Methods Used in A/B Testing\n",
    "### A. Two-Sample t-Test\n",
    "**Definition:** The t-test is used to compare the means of two groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them. \n",
    "- The two-sample t-test (also called an independent t-test) is used to compare the means of two groups. In A/B testing, it helps determine if a numerical metric (like average time spent on a page, revenue per user, etc.) is significantly different between two variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**\n",
    "- Independence – The samples must be independent.\n",
    "- Normality – The data should be normally distributed (if sample size is large, the Central Limit Theorem applies).\n",
    "- Equal Variances (for standard t-test) – If variances are unequal, we use Welch’s t-test.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Simple and widely used.\n",
    "- Works well with normally distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Assumes normality and equal variance in groups.\n",
    "- Less effective for small sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Comparing average spending per user.\n",
    "- Comparing time spent on a webpage between two versions.\n",
    "- Comparing average order value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### B. Chi-Square Test\n",
    "**Definition:** The chi-square test is used to determine if there is a significant association between categorical variables, often used for comparing proportions.\n",
    "- The Chi-Square test is used to compare proportions between two groups. In A/B testing, it is commonly used to compare conversion rates (e.g., how many users clicked a button or made a purchase).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**\n",
    "- Data is categorical (e.g., converted vs. not converted).\n",
    "- Expected frequency in each cell is at least 5 for reliable results.                                                                                                                                          \n",

    "- Does not assume a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Requires sufficiently large sample sizes.\n",
    "- Not ideal for very small data samples due to unstable results.\n",

    "### C. Bayesian A/B Testing\n",
    "**Definition:** Bayesian A/B testing uses probability distributions (Beta distributions) to model conversion rates and determine the probability of one variation being better than another.\n",
    "- Instead of a binary \"reject/fail to reject\" decision like t-tests, Bayesian A/B testing provides the probability that one variant is better than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Does it Work?**\n",
    "- We model the conversion rate as a Beta distribution.\n",
    "- We update beliefs with observed data using Bayes' Theorem.\n",
    "- We compute the probability that B is better than A.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Provides a probability of A being better than B rather than a binary yes/no decision.\n",

    "## 1. Selecting Metrics for Experimentation\n",
    "Choosing the right metrics ensures meaningful results. Consider:\n",
    "- **Primary Metric**: The main success indicator (e.g., conversion rate, revenue per user).\n",
    "- **Secondary Metrics**: Additional insights (e.g., bounce rate, average session duration).\n",
    "- **Leading Indicators**: Early signals that correlate with long-term impact.\n",
    "- **Guardrail Metrics**: Ensures the experiment does not negatively impact other areas (e.g., page load time, retention rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Align metrics with business goals.\n",
    "- Use metrics that are directly impacted by the test.\n",
    "- Avoid vanity metrics (e.g., total page views if engagement matters more).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Selecting Randomization Units\n",
    "Randomization ensures fairness in group assignment. Common units include:\n",
    "- **User-Level Randomization** (e.g., individual visitors, accounts): Ideal for personalized experiences.\n",
    "- **Session-Level Randomization**: Good for short-lived experiments but may introduce bias from repeat users.\n",
    "- **Device-Level Randomization**: Used when the user experience differs across devices.\n",
    "- **Geographic/Regional Randomization**: When running country-specific experiments.\n",
    "- **Cookie-Based Randomization**: Ensures consistent treatment per browser session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Ensure each unit has an equal chance of being assigned.\n",
    "- Minimize cross-group contamination.\n",
    "- Consider user behavior (e.g., multi-device users may need user-level randomization).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Choosing a Target Population\n",
    "Defining your target audience ensures valid, actionable results.\n",
    "- **General Population:** Testing on all users to understand broad impact.\n",
    "- **New Users:** Measuring the effect on first-time visitors.\n",
    "- **Returning Users:** Understanding impact on loyal customers.\n",
    "- **High-Intent Users:** Users already close to conversion.\n",
    "- **Geographic Segments:** Comparing behavior across different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Ensure the sample is representative of your actual audience.\n",

    "}\n",
    "n(0.1, 0.02) # Example calculation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Use online calculators (e.g., Optimizely, Evan Miller's calculator).\n",
    "- Ensure the test has enough power to detect real changes.\n",
    "- If results are inconclusive, increase sample size rather than reducing MDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Determining Test Duration\n",
    "The test duration depends on sample size, traffic, and expected conversion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Determine Duration:**\n",
    "1. **Estimate daily visitors** (per variant).\n",
    "2. **Compute required sample size** (from previous step).\n",
    "3. **Divide sample size by daily traffic** to get the test duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Run tests for at least **1-2 full business cycles** (to capture weekly patterns).\n",
    "- Avoid stopping tests too early based on interim results.\n",
    "- Use a sequential analysis approach for early stopping when necessary.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Analyzing Results\n",
    "Once data is collected, statistical analysis determines if the observed differences are significant.\n",

    "**Common Tests:**\n",
    "- **Two-Sample t-Test**: Compares means (e.g., revenue per user).\n",
    "- **Chi-Square Test**: Compares categorical data (e.g., conversion rates).\n",
    "- **Bayesian Analysis**: Provides probability estimates rather than binary outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **P-Value < 0.05**: Suggests statistical significance.\n",
    "- **Confidence Interval (CI)**: Helps understand the range of true effects.\n",
    "- **Lift Calculation**: Measures improvement between A and B.\n",

    "}\n",
    "lift(0.1, 0.12) # Example calculation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Ensure results remain stable before making decisions.\n",
    "- Segment results (e.g., by device, region) to uncover hidden trends.\n",
    "- Validate with a post-test analysis (e.g., long-term impact, retention).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Alternatives to A/B Testing\n",
    "If A/B testing is not feasible, consider alternative methods:\n",
    "- **Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)**: Adapts allocation dynamically to maximize performance.\n",
    "- **Sequential Testing**: Allows early stopping if results are conclusive.\n",
    "- **Synthetic Control Method**: Used when randomization is impractical.\n",
